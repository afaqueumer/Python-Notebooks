    "### What are Objects ?\n",
    "- An object is a custom data structure containing both __`data`__ (variables, called attributes) and __`code`__ (functions, called methods).\n",
    "- An object represents an individual thing, and its methods define how it interacts with other things.\n",

    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "Primitive data structures like numbers, strings, and lists are designed to represent simple pieces of information, such as the cost of an apple, the name of a poem, or your favorite colors, respectively. What if you want to represent something more complex? A great way to manage and maintain is to use classes.\n",

    "To create a new object that no one has ever created before, you first define a `class` that indicates what it contains.\n",
