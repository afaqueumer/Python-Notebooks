Python concepts in Jupyter Notebook 🚀

Python is an easy to learn 📖, powerful programming language 🪄. It has efficient high-level ⚡ data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms 🌈.

These notebooks does not seek to be comprehensive and cover every dimensions. Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style 🌟
